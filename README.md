# CMSC 203 - Computer Science I Coursework
This repository contains my coursework for CMSC 203 (Computer Science I) at Montgomery College. The course focuses on fundamental computer concepts and object-oriented programming using Java. Topics include:

Object-oriented program development and design

Language systems and semantics

Structured program verification

Different language paradigms

Documentation techniques

Students utilize a structured, high-level object-oriented programming language and learn to develop both text-oriented and Windows-based user interfaces. Designing and implementing solutions to intermediate-level programming assignments are integral parts of the course.
